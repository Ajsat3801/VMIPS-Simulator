# Dependencies
No third party libraries used. Code developed and tested on python 3.9.7

# How to run

To perform the timing simulation, run driver.py file to generate the result.  
To perform the design space analysis, run designSpaceAnalysis.py to generate the result.

Note: SDMEM.txt, VDMEM.txt, Code.asm, functionalSimulator.py and timingSimulator.py must be in the same directory.

The instruction files and sample inputs for dot product, fully connected, convolution and fast fourier transforms are also given in the inputs directory. 
To run the functions, the respective input files must be copied to the main directory.
